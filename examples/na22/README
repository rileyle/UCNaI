center.mac simulates the beta decay of 22Na with the source centered
between two 2x2 NaI detectors. (Coincidences between the two 511 keV
gamma rays from the annihilation of the positron produces in the beta
decay are observed.)

off_center.mac simulates the beta decay of 22Na with the source
placement offset from the line of sight between two 2x2 NaI
detectors. (No 511-511 keV coincidences are observed.)

center_vis.mac and off_center_vis.mac produce graphical visualizations
of the two arrangements (.wrl files).
