cs137.mac illustrates a simulation of the actual beta- decay of
137Cs producing the 137Ba daughter which emits a 663 keV gamma
ray. Auger electrons and the associated X-rays can also be produced.

cs137_simple.mac used the Simple gamma-ray source to emit 662 keV
gamma rays. This roughly a factor 10 faster.
